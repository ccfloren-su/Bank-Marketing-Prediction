The objective of these machine learning models is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit for a Portuguese banking institution based on a direct marketing campaign. We utilized PySpark on a heavily imbalanced dataset (89% no, 11% yes). We developed Gradient Boosted Trees achieving an AUC of 80%, with precision and recall scores in the high 80s. We created multiple models comparing macroeconomic data inclusion: one with all features, one excluding macroeconomic features, and one using only macroeconomic features, yielding actionable marketing insights.
